# Presentation
- We are 12 students.
- Teacher name's is Raphael.
- he is explaining the game rules.

- He tacles real problems instead of academic code.
- no slides

# Principles about clean code

- Code is meant to be read(by you, others and you in the future).
    - put good names.
    - you have to use it in six month
    - no ambiguous.
    - the compiler wont be affected but you will.
- Single responsability Principle: Each function / module / file does one thing.
- Boy scout rule: always leave your code `cleaner` than when you opened the file.
- KISS (Keep it simple stupid)
    - sometimes is complex, this is a process to achive SIMPLE
- YAGNI You aren't Gonna Need it.
    - you can remove some code but you have to ensure that this will not explode your code.
- DRY Don't Repeat yourself
    - you know this.
    - but if you put a flag, the nightmare starts.
    ```st
    a
        self c; d.
    b
        self c; d.
    ```
    then
    ```st
    a
        self e.
    b
        self e.
    e
        self c; d.
    
    ```
    - sometimes DRY is not good, it depends on the case, for example if a is `a` and `b` are very different then `e` will be very very complex

- Intention driven development 
    - DDD (domain driven development)

# Naming
- funcions/method should start / contains active verbs
- objects/structures should be nouns
- should helps to express the intention of your code

# Conventions

- in rome do like romans.
- defined by your team
- code smells
```
process(truck)
truck.process()
```
better information
```
process_unloading(truck)
truck.process_unloading()
```

- give as much information as you can but do not repeat
```st
"add noise"
vehicle fechVehicle.
"enough"
vehicle fetch.
```

- one function = one responsability well done.

- Single Responsibility Principle

- avoid flags
```
def process(trucks, slots, flag):
    if flag:
        # case a
    else:
        # case b

def process_a(trucks, slots):
    pass
def process_b(trucks, stots):
    pass
```
- try to minimize arguments
    - the fewer arguments you have the better
- side effects
    - Try to separate functions:
        - side effect free functions
        - side effect only function
    - Try to avoid functions that modify a global state

- command query separation
    - or the function/ method is doing processing (command).
    - or the function / method is quering the state of the system (query)
    ```
    def set_member(person):
        "set person membership and return true if new member"

    def is_member(person):
        "return true is person is member"
    def make_member(person):
        "add the person to members"
    ```

- DRY and generic
    - do not thing about first in generic.
    - its better if generic appears naturally
    - same with abstraction: why do we need this abstraction, have some clues and **facts**

# Comments
- Do not comment bad code, rewrite it.
- Very hard to keep comments in sync with the code.
- Good: signal
- Bad: Noise

```
index := 1. "index of the table"
```
better
```
indexTable := 1.
```

# Errors and exceptions
- Two families of errors:
    - the one I can deal with
    - the one I will crash / stop the program.

- Exception are part of the domain, make them meaningful. So we can take care of the situation.
- take care of them as soon as possible
```
try:
    process(a)
except ImproperA:
    process_improper(a)
```
If try part executes 50% with the expetion part 50% use an if then else.
- Some times we can not process exceptional situation.

```
try:
    process(a)
except ImproperA:
    log("improper", a)
    # shutdown properly
```
- avoid doing nothing
```
try:
    process(a)
except ImproperA:
    pass #state reason why it is ok
```

- better error passing
```
def average(numbers:list) -> int:
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
- but
```
def average(numbers:list) -> int:
    if not numbers:
        raise EmptyListError()
    if not_numbers(numbers)
        raise NotNumberError()

    temp = 0
    for i in numbers:
        if (Not isNumber(i))
            raise NotNumberError()
        temp += i

    return temp / len(numbers)
```

- null object patern
- or exceptions
- or a dictionary with valid values
- or polymorphims

# Boundaries
- The boundaries are the inputs and the Outputs.

- in inputs try to prevent bad data.
- single responsability principle
- one layer should depends only in inputs of another layer.

- a layer can be a method, class, package, project.
- one layer can not depend in internal components of another layer.
