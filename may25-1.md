# Testing

- Why writing a test
    - confidence in the code we write (it does what I expect)
    - confidence when changing the code that it does not break in another place.
- how to write a test
```st
"start with test"
testSomething
    "first setup"
    "exercise my system"
    "check expectations"
```
- to test methods, we test the result.
- to test objects, we test the state
