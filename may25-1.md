# Testing

- Why writing a test
    - confidence in the code we write (it does what I expect)
    - confidence when changing the code that it does not break in another place.
- how to write a test
```st
"start with test"
testSomething
    "first setup"
    "exercise my system"
    "check expectations"
```
- to test methods, we test the result.
- to test objects, we test the state
- tuples are inmutable
- check named tuple

# Organization
- what are the language / framework recommendation
- try to keep things small
- try to keep things highly coherent
- to stages in the life time of the execution step
    - setup / building the application using the dependency
    - running
- top down vs bottom up
    - top down
        - libraries
            - documentation / readme drive
                - write how the library is intended to be used.
                - then write the library
                - even in python you can run tests from comments
            - write the library with its associated tests
        - applications
    - bottom up
    - quite common in lips
